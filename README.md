# How to launch Jira sprints

This guide explains how to create, populate, and start a sprint in Jira.

## Creating a sprint project

1. From the Jira landing page, select the **Project** menu from the top menu bar.
2. In the Project menu, select **Create Project** as shown in this image:

   ![Create Project](#)

3. Select a template from the options on the left menu. Most sprints at Great Expectations use the **Software Development** template.
4. Select the **Scrum** project type.
5. At the bottom of the page, select **Use template**.
6. Select either the **Team-managed** or **Company-managed** board:
   - **Team-managed boards** give more autonomy to individual teams.
   - **Company-managed boards** prioritize centralized control and uniformity across projects.  
   For more details, see [Atlassian Support: Team-managed vs. Company-managed projects](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/learn-the-basics-of-team-managed-projects/).
7. Enter a name for the project in the **Name** field.
8. Select an access level. Most projects at Great Expectations use **Limited access**.
9. Select **Create project**. Your new project will now appear in the project menu in Jira.

## Populating a sprint

Now that you have created a sprint project, you can populate it with issues such as epics, stories, or tasks.

### Creating issues

Before populating your sprint, you need to create issues for any work tasks relevant to that sprint:

1. Ensure your Jira dashboard is in the project where you want to create issues. The selected project is shown in the top left of the dashboard:

   ![Project Selection](#)

2. From the left menu bar, select **Backlog**.
3. From the Backlog dashboard, select **Create issue**.

   ![Create Issue](#)

4. Select the issue type you want to create. Jira issue types include:
   - **Story**
   - **Epic**
   - **Task**
   - **Bug**  
   For more details on issue types, see the [Jira Documentation](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/issues/overview#what-is-an-issue).

5. Write a brief description of the issue you want to include.
6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 to create as many issues as needed.

### Migrating issues

If you have issues not assigned to your project, you can transfer them to your project:

1. Open the Jira issue you want to move to a new project.
2. Click on the **More** option within the issue window.
3. From the **More** dropdown menu, select **Move**.
4. In the **Move Issue** wizard, choose the project that you want to move the issue to.
5. Confirm the move.

## Starting a sprint

Now that you have a sprint populated with issues, you can launch the sprint to get it started:

1. From the left menu bar, select **Backlog**.
2. In the Backlog dashboard, select **Start sprint**. This opens a new window:

   ![Start Sprint](#)

3. Edit the sprint details as necessary. Be sure to specify:
   - A clear goal for the sprint.
   - A time estimate for completion.
4. Select **Start** in the Start Sprint window.
